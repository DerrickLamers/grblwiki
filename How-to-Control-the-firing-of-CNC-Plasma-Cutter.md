Hello everyone we have a project that is CNC Plasma Cutter, and We are using the software "Universal G-Code Sender" which is connected with the Arduino UNO. We are also using the Fusion 360 application from Autodesk for designing the output to be traced and generating the G-code.

How can I automatically control the firing of the plasma cutter when the operation starts (the torch starts to move, tracing the drawing) and then turn off when the operation ends?

Need help guys.
