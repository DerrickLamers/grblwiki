TODO: Write an extensive description of how the homing cycle works and solutions to common problems/misunderstanding.

- Ensure the machine is moving in the correct directions, i.e. Z+ up.
- How to enable homing and invoke it. 
- Default search is positive direction. Invert homing direction to look in other direction.
- Explain homing process. Limit switch search and locate cycles.
- Explain that homing search will look for switches within 1.5x max travel setting, and locate cycle within 5x pull off. 
- What is pull-off and homing delay. Pull off setting must be large enough to clear switch to avoid homing error. 

- How to configure for custom homing cycles.
- Common issues.
- And much more...
